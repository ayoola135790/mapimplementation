Map Implementation with Doubly Linked List

This project provides a custom Map class that implements a map-like data structure with a doubly linked list. The Map type associates unique string keys with double values and performs key-value operations.
Doubly Linked List Data Structure: The Map class uses a doubly linked list to store key-value pairs, allowing dynamic resizing and efficient insertions and deletions.
